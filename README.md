cxe is Control eXchangE package, used as showcase of dependency management using Poetry https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Env created in ~/AppData/Local/pypoetry/Cache/virtualenvs/cxe-tmp-9HDlInaK-py3.10/Scripts/, but i perform a copy of activate file in local folder / repo (https://github.com/alexandermolero/poetry/blob/poetry/activate), line 5 and 6 of Makefile

Also in Makefile i perform a cd to my local folder, but can be modified as cd cxe-tmp && poetry run python main.py (line 8 of Makefile)

Finally, python script using Poetry is in repo (file main.py : https://github.com/alexandermolero/poetry/blob/poetry/cxe-tmp/main.py)
